# Udacity Capstone project

## Installations:
The project has been done in the Anaconda enviroment with python 3.6 No packages outside anaconda is nescessary.


## Motivation:
This project has been conducted as the final project for Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. I chose to try and predict stock market direction one day ahead using machine learning algorithms and recurrent neural network

## Summary
Unfortunatly I have not been able to produce a good model to predict tomorrows stock market direction. I have used daily data and on this level, I have not been able to accurately predict.



## Files:
The project contains a Jupyter notebook where all the technical sides of the project has been conducted, A folder with the raw data and The projects report in PDF and DOCX format

## How to interact with this project.
I advice to read the PDF first. If you want to replicate or read the technical part of the project you can read through the jupyter notebook and interact with it if you want. The raw data is in the foler called support files

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
The project has been comnpleted by myself.
